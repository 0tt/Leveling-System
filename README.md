DarkRP Leveling System
======================
For DarkRP 2.5.0 and above.
Previously released on Coderhire, amassing 240 purchases. I've decided to release it for free. 
You can still buy the prestige DLC here: http://coderhire.com/scripts/view/1082


If you bought this script before I gave it away for free, I am very sorry. Consider it a donation to a poor dev :)

Features
-------
**7 Money Printers** - You can buy them and they give you money like normal printers, but they also give you XP. The printers could be an addon by themselves as you can add new ones with around 10 lines. No annoying copy/pasting like other printer addons.

**Database Support** - This script integrates directly into DarkRP's database. This means that it works with SQLite and MySQL! No tweaky setup required!

**HUD** - The HUD makes your server unique and provides level infomation to players. The XP bar is animated, and fits right in!

**Easy Installation** - You literally have to drag and drop one folder to install this.

**Supports future versions of DarkRP** - Beecause this script is a module, it doesn't edit DarkRP's core files. You can update DarkRP and not have to worry about re installing this script.

**ULX Support** - It allows you to set levels and add/remove XP with ULX. (optional)

**XP Books** - You can buy them and get XP from them. They are very easy to configure. (Disabled by default)

**Huge Configuration** - This script is VERY easy to customize. You can pretty much change everything from one file.  


Installation
-------
To start with, you must have the DarkRP Modification Addon installed on your server, which enables you to add custom content without editing core files. 
If you don’t have this, go here: https://github.com/FPtje/darkrpmodification/ 

Next, drag and drop everything inside this folder into your servers garrysmod folder. (It should merge into the current folders. If you don’t know what this means, you’ve probably still done it right).
You’ve installed the system. Woohoo! If you restart your server, everything should work!

Feel free to push changes.
