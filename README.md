DarkRP Leveling System
======================
For DarkRP 2.5.0 and above.
The most popular (and best) leveling system for Garry's Mod!


Features
-------
**7 Money Printers** - They work like normal printers, apart from the fact that they store money and XP. 

**Database Support** - This script integrates directly into DarkRP's database. This means that it works with SQLite and MySQL! No tweaky setup required!

**HUD** - The HUD looks good and provides level infomation to players. The XP bar is animated, and fits right in!

**Easy Installation** - Drag and drop one folder

**Supports future versions of DarkRP** - This script doesn't edit any of DarkRP's core files, so you don't have to worry about reinstalling the script when you update

**ULX Support** - Allows you to set levels and add/remove XP with ULX (optional)

**XP Books** - You can buy XP Books and get XP from them. (Disabled by default)

**Huge Configuration** - This script is VERY easy to customize. You can change everything from one file.  


Installation
-------
Drag and drop all 3 folders inside this folder into your servers garrysmod folder.

To configure the general system settings, edit config.lua

To edit printers and books, edit printers.lua and books.lua
