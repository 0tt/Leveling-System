DarkRP Leveling System
======================
For DarkRP 2.5.0 and above.
The most popular (and best) leveling system for Garry's Mod!


Features
-------
**7 Money Printers** - You can buy them and they give you money like normal printers, but they also give you XP and store the money and XP. It is also very easy to add printers. 

**Database Support** - This script integrates directly into DarkRP's database. This means that it works with SQLite and MySQL! No tweaky setup required!

**HUD** - The HUD makes your server unique and provides level infomation to players. The XP bar is animated, and fits right in!

**Easy Installation** - You literally have to drag and drop one folder to install this.

**Supports future versions of DarkRP** - Beecause this script is a module, it doesn't edit DarkRP's core files. You can update DarkRP and not have to worry about re installing this script.

**ULX Support** - It allows you to set levels and add/remove XP with ULX. (optional)

**XP Books** - You can buy them and get XP from them. They are very easy to configure. (Disabled by default)

**Huge Configuration** - This script is VERY easy to customize. You can pretty much change everything from one file.  


Installation
-------
Drag and drop all 3 folders inside this folder into your servers garrysmod folder. (It should merge into the current folders. If you don’t know what this means, you’ve probably still done it right).

To configure the system, you need to edit config.lua

To edit printers and books, please edit printers.lua and books.lua
